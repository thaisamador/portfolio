      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I work on turning complex datasets into meaningful insights through clear visualizations and efficient reporting systems. My experience includes automating processes, developing interactive dashboards, and implementing BI solutions across different business areas. I have worked with tools such as Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Looker, and Excel macros to support data‑driven decision‑making.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Business Intelligence from Tecnológico de Monterrey and I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional. I have completed professional certifications from Google and Oracle, expanding my skills in data analytics and cloud technologies. Professionally, I have gained experience through internships at Bradescard, Continental, and Tecnológico de Monterrey, working on projects related to automation, KPI tracking, and performance analysis. During my academic career, I collaborated with industry partners such as Driscoll’s, PiSA, and Urrea, achieving first and third place awards in institutional data analytics competitions.

      <h2>Events &amp; Communities</h2>
      <p>
        I have been actively involved in student organizations, including FETEC (Student Federation) and SELIT (Business Intelligence Student Society), where I developed leadership and project management skills. I am currently working on a personal initiative to create a platform that connects SMEs with students to collaboratively solve business challenges, integrating AI and emerging technologies to support growth in resource‑constrained environments.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal Touch</h2>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy staying active through strength training, exploring history, and continuously learning through courses and new challenges. I believe curiosity and adaptability are essential for both personal and professional growth.
